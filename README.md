## Overview üñ•Ô∏è
Every six months or so I get inspired by a new design and choose to entirely scrap the old version of my personal portfolio site. This is the fourth (!) revision of that process; check out some of my prior versions here:

- [Version 1 (Built on WordPress 6.1)](https://web.archive.org/web/20230513131828/https://ambercaravalho.com/)
    - I learned a bunch about self-hosting servers as well as the first shreds of web design.
- [Version 2 (Built on WordPress 6.2)](https://v2.ambercaravalho.com)
    - I wanted to replicate a *nix Bash terminal through its use of text-based user interface elements.
- [Version 3 (Built on WordPress 6.3)](https://v3.ambercaravalho.com)
    - Inspired by a post on Reddit and with too much time on my hands, the slides interface was born.

## Get To The Point! üò°

Okay, okay!! I'm kicking WordPress to the curb and diving headfirst into a shiny new framework (for the first time)! After some epic flip-flopping, I've landed on [Astro](https://astro.build) because it makes dealing with React components a breeze (or so I've been told üò∞). Feel free to watch me fumble around as I navigate this new world of development!
